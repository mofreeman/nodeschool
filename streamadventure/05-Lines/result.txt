Your solution to LINES passed!

Here's what the official solution is if you want to compare notes:

    var through = require('through');
    var split = require('split');
    
    var lineCount = 0;
    var tr = through(function (buf) {
        var line = buf.toString();
        this.queue(lineCount % 2 === 0
            ? line.toLowerCase() + '\n'
            : line.toUpperCase() + '\n'
        );
        lineCount ++;
    });
    process.stdin.pipe(split()).pipe(tr).pipe(process.stdout);
