Your solution to HTML STREAM passed!

Here's what the official solution is if you want to compare notes:

    var trumpet = require('trumpet');
    var through = require('through');
    var tr = trumpet();
    
    var loud = tr.select('.loud').createStream();
    loud.pipe(through(function (buf) {
        this.queue(buf.toString().toUpperCase());
    })).pipe(loud);
    
    process.stdin.pipe(tr).pipe(process.stdout);
